My personal blog (version 1).

<!-- more -->

## Latest news

This version of blog is not under active development, but you can still see an archived site at https://blog-v1.ansidev.xyz/.

## Story

I want a simple, speed solution for my personal blog.

Vue author released VitePress, a little brother of VuePress but it was built on top of Vite instead of Vue.

So I decided to try.

The official VueJS blog is using VitePress, so I just forked and customized it.

## Technologies

The blog is built with:
- [VitePress 0.x](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/).
- [TailwindCss 2.x](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com).

## Features

- PWA application.
- RSS Feed.
- Social sharing
- Medium Zoom for images.

## TODO:

This blog has many things to do:

- Dark theme.
- Comment system.
